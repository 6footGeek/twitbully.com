This is a project written in PHP that analyses the last X amount of tweets on a users timeline, sticks all the words in an array and then compares each word against a known list of badwords.
The users score is then worked out by amount of badwords and the severity of the badwords and the score is given back to the user.

Therefore becoming a very basic form of sentiment anaylysis.
