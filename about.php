                    <p>This website is a first year university project I researched.</p>
                    <p>The Basic purpose of the website is to analyse the last 30 tweets of a Twitter users handle, and then check the tweets for words that appear on a predefined Bad word list compiled in part by me.</p>
                    <p>This is a form of sentiment analysis using a sentiment lexicon as the trainer. It is not at all acurate at present so dont feel so bad if you got a level 5 score, its just a glowing result of your foul language!!</p>

                    <p>I plan on developing this website more at my leisure and refining the algorithm so that it learns from peoples language based on the tweets processed by the script. </p>
